Data + code to analyze and classify Rana Sierrae vocalizations


PAM data for this project was collected over the spring/summer 2023, 2024, and 2025 from high alpine lakes in the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA. Audiomoths (vrs 1.0.0, 1.1.0 & 1.2.0) were deplyoed in underwater case housing and attached to rocks so as to be fully submerged in the water. Recorders were set to record for 1 minute every 10 minutes.
